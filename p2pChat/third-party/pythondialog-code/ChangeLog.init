2013-09-17  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Prepare for the 2.14.0 release

	* dialog.py: minor docstring fix

	* dialog.py: bump the version number

2013-09-17  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Add a sample program really intended for newcomers

	* simple_example.py: new sample program, short, with absolutely no
	magic, intended for first-timers.

	* dialog.py: adapt the comments to point to this new file.

2013-09-17  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Improve structure and ESC handling in the demo

	* demo.py: new MyApp class that implements the core of the demo. This
	class relies on a new MyDialog class that automatically wraps every
	widget-producing method of dialog.Dialog in order to display the
	"confirm quit" dialog if the user presses the Escape key or the Cancel
	button. This class also provides a few dialog-related methods used in
	the demo.

	* demo.py: This new structure should completely fix handling of the
	Escape key, which was not satisfactory in previous versions since it
	required a while loop for every widget call that made the code redundant
	and harder to read. The new wrapping mechanism is completely transparent
	for most of the code in MyApp, which thus becomes shorter, more reliable
	and easier to read. The "magic" is contained within the MyDialog class.

	* A sample program for newcomers to pythondialog with absolutely no
	magic will be added in the next commit (simple_example.py).

2013-09-15  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Add an 'is_widget' attribute to Dialog widget-producing methods

	* dialog.py (widget): new decorator to mark the Dialog methods that
	provide a widget. As explained in the docstring, this allows code to
	perform automatic operations on these specific methods. For instance,
	one can define a class that behaves similarly to Dialog, except that
	after every widget-producing call, it spawns a "confirm quit" dialog if
	the widget returned DIALOG_ESC, and loops in case the user doesn't
	actually want to quit.

2013-09-14  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Check for too old versions of the backend

	* dialog.py: new exception InadequateBackendVersion

	* dialog.py: use it to abort when the user tries to use a programbox,
	rangebox or treeview widget with a dialog version that does not
	implement the widget in question.

	* demo.py: for the latest widgets added to dialog, check the version of
	the backend if it's dialog and display an explanation instead of the
	widget demo when it is too old.

2013-09-14  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Backend version caching and comparing

	* dialog.py (Dialog.backend_version): slight modification to the API:
	when the dialog-like backend does not return DIALOG_OK, raise
	UnableToRetrieveBackendVersion (new exception) instead of returning
	None. This way, the method either returns a string or raises an
	exception.

	* dialog.py: new DialogBackendVersion class (and BackendVersion abstract
	base class) for parsing the version string of the dialog backend,
	storing it in a structured format, and providing easy and reliable
	comparisons between versions using the standard comparison operators (<,
	<=, ==, !=, >=, >).

	* dialog.py (Dialog.__init__): retrieve the backend version and store
	the corresponding (Dialog)BackendVersion instance into a public
	'cached_backend_version' attribute. This should avoid having to run
	'<backend> --print-version' every time someone needs the version.

	* demo.py: use Dialog.cached_backend_version.

2013-09-11  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Minor fixes

	* dialog.py: prefix OSErrorHandling with an underscore.

	* dialog.py: rename *_rec private attributes to the corresponding *_cre
	(Compiled Regular Expression).

	* dialog.py: add treeview to the list of widgets in the Dialog class
	docstring (forgotten when the widget support was added).

2013-09-11  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Misc demo improvements

	* demo.py: move a bunch of widget demos from additional_widgets() to the
	main demo() function to give them more visibility. The remaining widgets
	in additional_widgets() either have little warts (like programbox which
	is waiting for a fix in the dialog backend), are cumbersome to use in
	the demo (this is the case of progressbox_demo_with_filepath), or are
	almost identical to widgets already presented in the main part of the
	demo.

	* demo.py: use the current local time to initialize the timebox widget.

	* demo.py: minor improvements.

2013-09-11  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Add support for 'treeview'

2013-09-10  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Add support for 'rangebox'

	Add support for 'programbox'

2013-09-07  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Factor out OSError and IOError handling

	* dialog.py: use a context manager to factor out OSError and IOError
	handling throughout the module.

2013-09-06  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Add support for new dialog common options

	* dialog.py: add support for --default-button and --no-tags.

2013-09-06  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Add version_info to dialog.py

	* dialog.py: new 'version_info' module-level attribute, similar to what
	the 'sys' module provides. This avoids the need to parse __version__
	when one wants to extract for instance the major and/or minor version
	number of pythondialog.

2013-09-06  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Minor improvements

2013-08-22  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Remove the installation prefix from setup.cfg and release 2.13.1

	* From now on, pythondialog releases will follow a major.minor.micro
	versioning scheme.

	* setup.cfg: remove the /usr/local installation prefix that breaks
	installations with pip in a virtualenv, at least.

	* INSTALL: update the installation and uninstallation instructions to
	document and favor the method based on pip.

2013-08-20  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Demo improvement with Dialog.maxsize()

	* demo.py: pass the available (terminal-dependent) width and height to
	demo() and additional_widgets(); use this information to display a
	tailbox widget that almost fills the screen (whatever the terminal
	size).

2013-08-19  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Release 2.13

	* setup.cfg: don't build zip files anymore, as I don't think anyone
	using pythondialog could be unable to uncompress a tar.gz or tar.bz2
	file.

	* demo.py: "Mayonnaise" is spelt with two n's, dammit!

2013-08-19  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	New method Dialog.set_background_title(), better Dialog doc

	* dialog.py (Dialog.set_background_title): new method. Now that we deal
	with dash escaping, such a method does become useful since it avoids
	users having to use the low-level Dialog.add_persistent_args() and
	bother with dash escaping.

	* dialog.py (Dialog.setBackgroundTitle): this old method from
	pythondialog 1.0 is still deprecated because its case style is
	inconsistent with the rest of pythondialog; it simply calls
	Dialog.set_background_title() after printing a DeprecationWarning.

	* dialog.py (Dialog): add set_background_title, maxsize and
	backend_version to the docstring and reorganize a bit the list of public
	methods.

	* demo.py: use the new method.

2013-08-19  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Add demo code for the timebox widget

2013-08-16  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Prepare for the 2.12 release

	* dialog.py: add a copyright notice for Peter Åstrand because of commit
	v2.09-2-ga3429a4.

	* setup.py: put python3 in the shebang line; change 'url' and
	'download_url' to point to SourceForge.

	* Minor documentation updates and editorial changes for the release.

2013-08-16  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Provide an implementation of textwrap.indent() in demo.py

	This is for Python versions < 3.3, where this function is not in the
	standard library.

2013-08-16  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Make debugging easier

	* dialog.py: there is no need to copy/paste Python code from the
	DEBUGGING file into dialog.py anymore in order to see the command lines
	corresponding to the dialog calls. Just call
	d.setup_debug(True, file=<file object>) to turn debugging on and
	d.setup_debug(False) to turn it off, where d is obviously a Dialog
	instance.

	* demo.py: new options --debug and --debug-file to activate debugging
	and specify where the debug log is written to.

	* DEBUGGING: not useful anymore.
	* MANIFEST.in: don't ship DEBUGGING anymore.

	* README.rst: mention this in a new "Troubleshooting" section.

2013-08-15  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	New dialog.__version__ attribute

	* dialog.py: new dialog.__version__ attribute

	* demo.py: use it to print the pythondialog version in the first screen

	* setup.py: use dialog.__version__

2013-08-15  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Add support for --print-version and --print-maxsize

	* dialog.py (Dialog.backend_version, Dialog.maxsize): new methods that
	respectively extract the relevant info from dialog --print-version and
	--print-maxsize.

	* demo.py: use them to display the backend version and terminal size in
	the first screen (+ Python version as a bonus); also warn if the
	terminal is too small, which might be the cause of Ubuntu#694824.

2013-08-15  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	New arg 'use_persistent_args' for _call_program() and _perform()

	* dialog.py (Dialog._call_program, Dialog._perform): new argument
	'use_persistent_args' that allows to skip the insertion of
	dialog_persistent_arglist. This is necessary to use for instance
	--print-version without emptying dialog_persistent_arglist first.

	* dialog.py (Dialog._call_program, Dialog._perform): to enhance
	readability and maintainability, make all keyword arguments of these
	methods keyword-only.

2013-08-13  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Add support for common options from dialog 1.1-20120215

	* dialog.py: add support for dialog common options --ascii-lines,
	--colors, --column-separator, --date-format, --exit-label,
	--extra-button, --extra-label, --hfile, --hline, --keep-tite,
	--keep-window, --no-collapse, --no-lines, --no-mouse, --no-nl-expand,
	--no-ok, --scrollbar, --time-format, --trace and --visit-items
	(closes: Ubuntu#739873).

2013-08-12  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Improve exception handling

	* dialog.py: don't assume that exceptions are strings; thus, use str()
	to obtain the message when translating from a "foreign" exception to a
	subclass of dialog.error.

	* dialog.py: use str(e) instead of e.strerror when e is an OSError
	instance, because e.strerror does not contain the file name (even when
	there is one available in e.filename), contrary to str(e).

	* dialog.py: prepare the transition from PythonDialogIOError to
	PythonDialogOSError. PythonDialogIOError is now a subclass of
	PythonDialogOSError so that users can safely replace "except
	PythonDialogIOError" clauses with "except PythonDialogOSError" even if
	running under Python < 3.3. pythondialog will raise PythonDialogOSError
	instead of PythonDialogIOError when Python stops distinguishing between
	IOError and OSError, i.e. when running under Python 3.3 or later.

	* dialog.py: use "raise ... from ..." (available in Python >= 3.0) where
	appropriate.

2013-08-11  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Conform to the gauge protocol described in dialog(1)

	* dialog.py (Dialog.gauge_update): actually conform to the gauge
	protocol described in dialog(1); this fixes a slight synchronization bug
	when 'update_text' is True (closes: SF#3; thanks to MapK for spotting
	this and providing a patch).

	* dialog.py (Dialog.gauge_update): raise BadPythonDialogUsage if the
	'percent' argument is not an integer, since this is the only type
	accepted by the gauge protocol as described in dialog(1).

2013-08-10  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Escape non-option arguments to dialog that start with --

	* dialog.py (_dash_escape): new function that inserts a '--' element
	before every element in a list that starts with '--' (returns a new
	list).

	* dialog.py (_dash_escape_nf): same as _dash_escape, but ignores the
	first element.

	* dialog.py (Dialog.dash_escape, Dialog.dash_escape_nf): new class
	methods for public use, for those using Dialog.add_persistent_args().

	* dialog.py (Dialog._call_program): new keyword argument 'dash_escape'
	to control the dash-escaping of the argument list; by default, the
	appropriate part is filtered through _dash_escape_nf().

	* dialog.py (Dialog._perform): new keyword argument 'dash_escape' that
	is passed as is to Dialog._call_program() (closes: SF#5; thanks to
	Denilson Figueiredo de Sá for the report).

	* dialog.py: use _dash_escape_nf() where appropriate in
	_common_args_syntax for options that are passed as keyword arguments
	(e.g., title="...").

	* dialog.py (Dialog.setBackgroundTitle): use self.dash_escape_nf() in
	this long-deprecated method.

2013-07-28  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Standard-behaving __str__ and __repr__ for our exceptions

	* dialog.py:error.__str__(): return the exception message instead of
	something enclosed in angle brackets.

	* Compatibility is not affected unless one had the ill-advised idea to
	parse the return value of __str__. The complete_message() method of
	exceptions behaves exactly as before.

	* demo.py: use the new, more standard method, to retrieve the error
	  message.

2013-07-28  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Use os.path.abspath(__file__) to refer to the demo source file

	* This avoids problems when running the demo from a directory that is
	not the one containing demo.py (closes: SF#4).

2013-07-27  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* README: rename to README.rst, convert to reStructuredText and
	update for Python 3
	* INSTALL: update for Python 3
	* MANIFEST.in: include README.rst
	* setup.py: update for Python 3 and the README -> README.rst
	change, email address update

2013-06-19  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Replace the question for the calendar demo with a non-perishable one

	* demo.py: the question about an estimate of Debian *** release is
	bound to become out-of-date. Replace it with a question that will
	not need a change every couple of years.

2013-06-19  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Minor improvements

	* demo.py: use locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '') to properly
	initialize the locales

	* dialog.py: code readability improvement

2013-06-19  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Minor bug fixes

	* dialog.py(_to_onoff): regexp match against "on$"/"off$" instead
	of "on"/"off".

	* dialog.py: more rigorous handling of "title" and "help_button"
	keyword arguments. For instance, passing 'title=None' to a
	function that gets this argument through its **kwargs results in a
	kwargs dictionary that does contain a "title" key (with None as
	the corresponding value); therefore '"title" not in kwargs' is not
	a great test to determine if the title should be set to a default
	value.

2013-06-19  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Favor usage of True/False over 1/0 and on/off in dialog.py and
	demo.py, docstrings included.

2013-06-19  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Improve error handling

	* dialog.py(_to_onoff): actually raise an exception when the given
	parameter is a string that doesn't represent a boolean according
	to the regexps.

	* demo.py: when handling exceptions at top level, start by
	printing a traceback, which is always very practical to find the
	origin of problems.

2013-06-18  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Replace assert statements with PythonDialogBug exceptions.

	This is less practical for coding in dialog.py but makes it easier
	for dialog.py users to catch all (most) exceptions that come from
	pythondialog.

2013-06-18  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Cosmetic changes

	* Change deprecated %u into %d.

	* Remove trailing whitespace.

	* Coding-style update for the generic exception.

2013-06-18  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Improve error reporting between fork() and execve()

	* Print a traceback if an error happens between fork() and
	execve() when calling dialog.

2013-06-18  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Basic porting to Python 3.

2010-03-17  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* dialog.py: Move the definition of _simple_option() before its uses
	which, according to
	<https://sourceforge.net/p/pythondialog/patches/2/>,
	"makes pydev happy when browsing the code".

	* dialog.py: Remove the "True = 0 == 0" and "False = 0 == 1"
	compatibility measures that were still in place for Python
	versions < 2.3. Such old versions are not supported anymore; besides,
	True and False are becoming reserved words in Python 3.

2010-03-16  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Release 2.11.

	* README: I thought I was adding a valuable precision in version 2.09
	when I changed "LGPL" to "LGPL version 2.1" in the README file (after
	looking at COPYING), but actually, the terms at the beginning of
	dialog.py are "either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option)
	any later version". Sorry about that, fixed.

	* demo.py: use "if <test> <expr1> else <expr2>" expressions more
	often, since they are allowed in Python >= 2.5...

2010-03-16  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Release 2.10.

	* dialog.py: add Peter Åstrand's modifications to deal with
	Xdialog's incompatibilities with respect to dialog:
	  - new "use_stdout" keyword argument for Dialog.__init__()
	  - factoring of final newline removals with the addition of
	    Dialog._strip_xdialog_newline().

	* dialog.py: add support for dialog options --no-label,
	--yes-label and --insecure (the last one not being so dangerous as
	the name seems to imply: "Makes the password widget friendlier but
	less secure, by echoing asterisks for each character"; BTW, kdm
	has a very nice way of handling this issue IMO: an option that
	echoes each character with x asterisks, where x = 3 IIRC).

2010-03-14  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Release 2.09.

	* dialog.py: new supported widgets: editbox, inputmenu, mixedform,
	mixedgauge, pause, passwordform, progressbox.

	* demo.py: general improvements, such as:
	    - hopefully more helpful dialog when the user fails to select
	      a file in fselect;
	    - since actually selecting a file with this widget is already
	      boring after the second time, the widget can be exited by
	      pressing Esc or the Cancel button (in which case the parts
	      of the demo that need the file path will be skipped).
	    - replace a few calls to Dialog.scrollbox() by calls to
	      Dialog.msgbox(), since the latter provides nice automatic
	      line wrapping.

	* demo.py: support GNU-style option passing with getopt.py; you
	can use --help to get a list of available options
	* demo.py: no need to change a global variable anymore to switch
	the demo to "fast mode", just use --fast
	* demo.py: add --test-suite mode, mainly for developers: it
	tests *all* widgets, not only those included in the "default
	mode", and automatically enables "fast mode".

	* dialog.py(__call_program): make the function more generic. stdin
	redirection doesn't involve automatic pipe(2) creation in
	__call_program() anymore; instead, __call_program expects a file
	descriptor when it is asked to redirect dialog's stdin (parameter
	'redir_child_stdin_from_fd').

	The caller may still decide to create a pipe and pass its file
	descriptor for reading as the 'redir_child_stdin_from_fd'
	parameter, but the new possibility of redirecting dialog's stdin
	from an arbitrary file descriptor allows for instance to redirect
	it from an existing file, network socket... This is used to
	implement --progressbox cleanly.

	This change has the additional benefit of simplifying the API,
	since __call_program()'s return value is always a 2-element tuple
	now.

	* dialog.py(__call_program): new close_fds option causing the
	child process to close the specified file descriptors before the
	execve(2) system call. This is useful for instance to have the
	child close an end of a pipe he isn't going to use. Without that,
	deadlocks could happen because of the child never seeing EOF from
	the pipe.

	* dialog.py: use warnings.warn(..., DeprecationWarning) for
	obsolete functions.

	* dialog.py: remove convoluted syntax *(<list>,) that was used at
	several places. I don't see any use for this syntax anymore, and
	changing it to simply <list> didn't make the universe collapse (so
	far).

	* dialog.py: prefix attributes for internal use (such as
	Dialog._call_program) with a single underscore instead of a double
	one: we don't need the name mangling here. These underscores in
	dialog.py are just an indication that the attribute is "internal"
	and thus subject to API changes, etc. Thanks to Peter Åstrand for
	pointing this out.

	* setup.py:
	  - improve the long description, use ReStructuredText
	  - add Trove classifiers
	  - add download_url

	* Review and update README, TODO...

2010-02-19  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: add support for --dselect
	* dialog.py: add support for DIALOG_ITEM_HELP
	* demo.py: small fixes

2009-10-31  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.08, skipping version 2.07 to avoid creating confusion
	with the 2.7 version released by Peter Åstrand in 2004.

2009-02-04  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Add support for --form.

	* dialog.py(__call_program): compute the argument list before
	forking, otherwise things get difficult to understand if this
	computation raises an exception.

2004-03-29  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.06.

2004-03-19  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: fixed a bug with the default_item "common argument"
	(corresponding to dialog's --default-item option) thanks to Peter
	Mathiasson.

2004-03-16  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* demo.py: make sure the directory passed to --fselect ends with
	os.sep so that its contents can be seen right away in the file
	selection box displayed by dialog.

2004-03-15  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: fix a bug (the standard output of the process running
	dialog used to be connected to a pipe) that rendered pythondialog
	unusable with recent versions of dialog (thanks, Peter Åstrand!).

	* dialog.py: the generic exception is now 'error' ('dialog.error',
	if you understand this better). The old name is still there for
	backward-compatibility.
	* Several new exceptions have appeared: PythonDialogSystemError,
	PythonDialogIOError, PythonDialogOSError,
	PythonDialogErrorBeforeExecInChildProcess,
	PythonDialogReModuleError, UnableToCreateTemporaryDirectory,
	PythonDialogBug, ProbablyPythonBug.
	* dialog.py: the ExecutableNotFound exception was not mentioned in
	the docstring module. Fixed.
	* dialog.py: the complete_message() of 'error' instances does not
	write a dot at the end of the message anymore.
	* dialog.py: rename the ExceptionPrettyIdentifier attribute of
	'error' subclasses to ExceptionShortDescription.
	* dialog.py: the constructor of 'error' instances can now be
	called with no argument if no useful message can be added to the
	ExceptionShortDescription.

	* dialog.py: added the new DIALOG_EXTRA and DIALOG_HELP return
	codes that appeared somewhere between versions 0.9a-20020309a and
	0.9b-20040301 of dialog.

	* dialog.py: Remove the possibility to choose (from Dialog's
	constructor) the values of the DIALOG_{OK,CANCEL,ERROR,...}
	environment variables passed to dialog because this is absolutely
	useless as far as I can see and clutters the API.

	* dialog.py: Dialog's constructor has a new 'compat' parameter
	that can be used to enable a compatibility mode with dialog-like
	programs whose interface is only slightly different from that of
	dialog. The demo runs fine with Xdialog 2.0.6 in the "Xdialog"
	compatibility mode. However, I don't want the special cases to
	expand too much, so it would be really better for you to report
	bugs if your dialog-like program is not dialog-compatible!

	* dialog.py: don't try any PATH components (nor any components
	from ":/bin:/usr/bin" if PATH is undefined) if the 'dialog'
	parameter of Dialog's constructor contains a '/'.

	* dialog.py: somewhere between versions 0.9a-20020309a and
	0.9b-20040301, dialog started not to quote tags in the output of
	--checklist if they didn't contain any space. Adapt the dialog
	invocation (now using --separate-output) and the output parsing
	accordingly (still works with 0.9a-20020309a).

	* dialog.py: the data fed to dialog in Dialog.gauge_update()
	happened to work with dialog 0.9a-20020309a but did not conform to
	the manual page and presumably broke Xdialog. This is fixed,
	thanks to Peter Åstrand.

	* dialog.py: modifications in Dialog.scrollbox():
	    - don't use the old insecure tempfile.mktemp() anymore
	      (tempfile.mkstemp() didn't exist before Python 2.3)
	    - don't display a title for the box if no title was in kwargs
	    - the return value is now that of the dialog-like program
	    - UnableToCreateTemporaryDirectory is now raised if for some
	      strange reason, we cannot create a temporary directory

	* dialog.py: review every function to catch possible exceptions
	such as IOError and OSError, in order to turn them into subclasses
	of 'error' (such as PythonDialogIOError and PythonDialogOSError).
	Rare beasts such as MemoryError are still not caught. Such an
	enterprise would be unreasonable, if not simply impossible.
	* dialog.py: updated the various docstrings to show which
	exceptions every function can raise. To make this manageable, many
	functions refer to the docstrings of internal, heavily-used
	functions such as Dialog.__perform whose docstrings are,
	unfortunately but rightfully, not included in the HTML
	documentation generated by pydoc. Some sort of automated
	documentation generation system would be needed to solve this
	problem in a satisfactory way.

	* demo.py: minor update with respect to Debian sarge's release
	date forecasts...

2003-09-16  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.05.

	* Changed the "private" class names to start with two underscores
	instead of one.

2003-09-01  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.04.

	* dialog.py: Replaced the apply() calls with calls using the
	"extended call syntax" since apply() is deprecated since the
	release of Python 2.3.

2002-09-05  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.03.

	* dialog.py: Reorganized the documentation between the module's
	docstring and that of the Dialog class.

	* README: Added the "history" section and other improvements.

2002-09-04  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Prefixed global variables with an underscore and
	made some cosmetic fixes.

	* dialog.py: Removed the set_background_title alias to
	setBackgroundTitle since nobody uses it yet and setBackgroundTitle
	is obsolete. Even though I prefer set_background_title to
	setBackgroundTitle for consistency with other methods, there is no
	point in adding an obsolete method.

2002-09-03  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Packaged pythondialog with Distutils.

	* Improved the README.

2002-09-02  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Improved the common_args_syntax initialization so
	that simple dialog Common Options can be passed as foo=1 keyword
	arguments with 1 having a real boolean meaning (was not the case
	before).

	* Handled the licensing stuff : GNU LGPL license for dialog.py and
	public domain for demo.py. Added the COPYING file.

	* dialog.py: Wrote a proper module docstring.

	* demo.py: Added the last widgets to the demo.

2002-08-30  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Added the calendar, fselect, passwordbox, tailbox and
	timebox widgets.

2002-08-29  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py (_wait_for_program_termination): Raises a DialogError
	exception when dialog returns self.DIALOG_ERROR. Exceptions are so
	handy.

	* demo.py: Cleaned up the demo code making it easier (I hope) to
	focus on a given widget, added error handling.
	* dialog.py: Took the demo to put it in a new, separate file:
	demo.py.


2002-08-21  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Documented the widgets properly.
	* dialog.py: Generalized the widgets that didn't offer all the
	capabilities available from dialog.
	* dialog.py: Went through the various widgets so that the
	associated methods return the dialog exit status (with additional
	information, if relevant).

	* dialog.py: Finally cleaned up the method used to collect the
	arguments given to dialog. They are now stored as elements of a
	list and properly quoted to protect them from shell expansion just
	before the call to popen3. Now, you should be safe with any
	character in the strings passed to dialog (labels, texts, etc.).

2002-08-09  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: All boxes should now support the common arguments
	scheme (well, I still have to look at the gauge closer).

	* dialog.py: Added support for "common arguments"; now, you can
	use any combination of the _common options_ for the dialog program
	when creating a box. Example:

	   d.checklist(<usual args for a checklist box>,
	               title="...", backtitle="...", <other common args>)

	One thing is still broken: we must shell-escape the strings so
	that apostrophes (') used to delimit shell arguments don't clash
	with apostrophes used these arguments themselves.

	* dialog.py: Added support for "persistent arguments" arguments
	(--backtitle is a good candidate for this).

	* dialog.py: Removed a leftover debugging print in _perform.

	* dialog.py: Simplified the DIALOG* arguments handling.

2002-08-08  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Added a short docstring for the module.

	* dialog.py: Rewrote checklist to get all the features from the
	corresponding option in dialog.

	* dialog.py: Rewrote _perform; now, we can use the DIALOG*
	environment variables set in the constructor, which allows us
	distinguish between ESC pressed and a dialog error, among others;
	also, we use no temporary file anymore to store dialog's stderr.

	* dialog.py: Added some exceptions.

	* dialog.py: Rewrote __init__; now, we can set choose in the
	constructor the DIALOG* environment variables to pass the dialog
	program as well as this program (could be whiptail for instance)
	from the constructor (and the environment variables can be
	different for two Dialog instances used in the same python
	process...).

	* dialog.py: Renamed __foo methods to _foo.

2002-08-07  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Cosmetic fixes.

	* dialog.py: Added a proper GPL header (dialog.py only had a short
	mention about its license being the GNU GPL).

	* Split dialog.py, creating a Changelog file in the format
	described in the GNU Coding Standards, as well as README, AUTHORS,
	COPYING and TODO.

2000-07-30  Sultanbek Tezadov (http://sultan.da.ru/)

	* dialog.py: Added the gauge widget.

	* dialog.py: Added a 'title' option to some widgets.

	* dialog.py: Added a 'checked' option to the checklist dialog;
	clicking "Cancel" is now recognizable.

	* dialog.py: Added a 'selected' option to the radiolist dialog;
	clicking "Cancel" is now recognizable.

	* dialog.py: Some other cosmetic changes and improvements.

2000-??-??  Robb Shecter <robb@acm.org>

	* Initial release.
